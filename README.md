## Installation

[Download](https://github.com/abhi-kr-2100/CatLauncher/releases/latest) the appropriate file for your operating system:

- Windows: .exe
- macOS: .dmg
- Linux: .deb, .rpm, .AppImage

### Windows

Windows may warn about downloading unidentified .exe files. To download, click on the three-dots menu and select "Keep". When you run the .exe file, you'll receive another blocking screen. To proceed with the installation, you must click on "More info" and then select "Run anyway".

CatLauncher is 100% open-source and the .exe is built directly from the source code via GitHub Actions. This ensures there is no opportunity for malicious actors to tamper with the executable. CatLauncher is safe to use.

### macOS

By default, macOS does not allow running applications from unidentified developers. To allow CatLauncher, open System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General and click on the lock icon to make changes. Then, click on the "Open Anyway" button next to CatLauncher. You should do this after trying to run the .dmg file and failing.

Ensure that you download the correct .dmg file depending on your macOS architecture. You can check your macOS architecture by running the command `uname -m` in the terminal. If the output is `x86_64`, download the `x86_64.dmg` file. If the output is `arm64`, download the `arm64.dmg` file.

Another way to accomplish this is by disabling Gatekeeper. See https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/.

### Linux

Downloading the AppImage is the easiest way to install CatLauncher and keep it automatically up-to-date. However, the AppImage may not work on all Linux distros. It's been tested to work on Ubuntu 24.04.

To use the AppImage, download it, and make it executable by running `chmod a+x cat-launcher_0.7.0_amd64.AppImage`, and then run it like you would any other executable.

If you encounter issues with the AppImage, you can try installing CatLauncher using the .deb or the .rpm package. It would also help if you can open an issue on GitHub with details of your distro.
